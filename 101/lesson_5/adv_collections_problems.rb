# Problems lesson 5 Advanced Collections

# The purpose of these practice problems is to let you practice the specific
# concepts covered in the last three assignments; in some cases there may
# exist a Ruby method that lets you achieve the same result as passing a block
# to an iterative method but that isn't the objective here. Feel free to
# research those methods if you wish but you should try and solve the problems
# using the concepts and techniques outlined in the previous
# assignments. (so: sort (<=>), sort_by and nested collections)

############
# problem_1
# How would you order this array of number strings by descending numeric value?

arr = ['10', '11', '9', '7', '8']

############
# problem_2
# How would you order this array of hashes based on the year of publication
# of each book, from the earliest to the latest?

books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]

############
# problem_3  !
# For each of these collection objects demonstrate how you would reference
# the letter 'g'.

arr1 = ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g']]]

arr2 = [{first: ['a', 'b', 'c'], second: ['d', 'e', 'f']},
        {third: ['g', 'h', 'i']}]

arr3 = [['abc'], ['def'], {third: ['ghi']}]

hsh1 = {'a' => ['d', 'e'], 'b' => ['f', 'g'], 'c' => ['h', 'i']}

hsh2 = {first: {'d' => 3}, second: {'e' => 2, 'f' => 1}, third: {'g' => 0}}

############
# problem_4
# For each of these collection objects where the value 3 occurs,
# demonstrate how you would change this to 4.

arr1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]

arr2 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: [7, 6, 5], d: 4}, 3]

hsh1 = {first: [1, 2, [3]]}

hsh2 = {['a'] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}

# problem_5 !!
# Given this nested Hash:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# figure out the total age of just the male members of the family

############
# problem_6

# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of
# "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it
# with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender
# of each family member:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# ...like this:

# (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

############
# problem_7 !

# Given this code, what would be the final values of a and b? Try to work this
# out without running the code.

a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]

arr[0] += 2
arr[1][0] -= a

p a
p b
p arr

# problem_8 (!)

# Using the each method, write some code to output all of the vowels from the
# strings

hsh = {first: ['the', 'quick'], second: ['brown', 'fox'], third: ['jumped'],
       fourth: ['over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']}

############
# problem_9 (!)

# Given this data structure, return a new array of the same structure but with
# the sub arrays being ordered (alphabetically or numerically as appropriate)
# in descending order.

arr = [['b', 'c', 'a'], [2, 1, 3], ['blue', 'black', 'green']]

############
# problem_10 !!!

# Given the following data structure and without modifying the original array,
# use the map method to return a new array identical in structure to the
# original but where the value of each integer is incremented by 1.

arr = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}]

############
# problem_11 (!)

# Given the following data structure use a combination of methods, including
# either the select or reject method, to return a new array identical in
# structure to the original but containing only the integers that are
# multiples of 3.

arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 13, 15]]

############
# problem_12 !

# Given the following data structure, and without using the Array#to_h method,
# write some code that will return a hash where the key is the first item in
# each sub array and the value is the second item.

arr = [[:a, 1], ['b', 'two'], ['sea', {c: 3}], [{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}, 'D']]

############
# problem_13 !!!

# Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same
# sub-arrays as the original but ordered logically according to the numeric
# value of the odd integers they contain.

arr = [[1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 3]]

# The sorted array should look like this:

# [[1, 8, 3], [1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9]]


############
# problem_14  !!!

# Given this data structure write some code to return an array containing
# the colors of the fruits and the sizes of the vegetables. The sizes should
# be uppercase and the colors should be capitalized.

hsh = {
  'grape' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'small'},
  'carrot' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'apple' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'medium'},
  'apricot' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'marrow' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['green'], size: 'large'},
}

# The return value should look like this:

# [["Red", "Green"], "MEDIUM", ["Red", "Green"], ["Orange"], "LARGE"]

############
# problem_15 !!!

# Given this data structure write some code to return an array which contains
# only the hashes where all the integers are even.

arr = [{a: [1, 2, 3]}, {b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4]}, {e: [8], f: [6, 10]}]

# problem_16 (!)


# A UUID is a type of identifier often used as a way to uniquely identify
# items...which may not all be created by the same system. That is, without
# any form of synchronization, two or more separate computer systems can
# create new items and label them with a UUID with no significant chance of
# stepping on each other's toes.

# It accomplishes this feat through massive randomization. The number of
# possible UUID values is approximately 3.4 X 10E38.

# Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters, and is typically broken
# into 5 sections like this 8-4-4-4-12 and represented as a string.

# It looks like this: "f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91"

# Write a method that returns one UUID when called with no parameters.
